Mainflux Core is core service of [Mainflux IoT Cloud Platform](https://github.com/mainflux/mainflux).

It exposes an API for system provisioning and management.

### Security
For professional deployments Mainflux is usually combined with [Mainflux Authentication and Authorization Server](https://github.com/mainflux/mainflux-core-auth-server) which adds fine-grained security based on customizable API keys.

Mainflux Auth Server also provides user accounts and device and application access control with simple customizable scheme based on scoped JWTs.

### Install/Deploy
Mainflux Core uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), so insure that it is installed on your system. You will also need to run [NATS](https://github.com/nats-io/gnatsd). Finally, [Mainflux MQTT broker](https://github.com/mainflux/mainflux-mqtt) needs to be running also.

Installing Mainflux is trivial [`go get`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/):
```bash
go get github.com/mainflux/mainflux-core
$GOBIN/mainflux-core
```
